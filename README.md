# Some info about me

I am a 16 years old german dude who started with serious programming in october 2021, since then I did many projects already. From image converter to performance display apps!
I have a big interest in programming ever since I was 11, back then I used to follow some little python tutorials along and modify things a little bit to my likings.

# My personallity

I'm an introvert and very very shy dude that got some social anxiety + a depression, I spend most of the time in my room porgramming which keeps me happy.
